An administrator will create the repository once the TSC approves it. All
repositories require DCO sign-off, which is enabled organization-wide.

1. Invite the owner of the repository to the linuxonzapps organization, under
"People"

2. Once they accept the invitation, go to "Collaborators and Teams" to add the
new owner to the repository in the "Maintain" capacity

3. Optional: CODEOWNERS

 - If you wish to have automatic reviewers set up, a CODEOWNERS file needs to be
created in the repository as well, see [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) for an
example.

 - The team or users who are added as automatic reviewers will also need Write
access to the repository, which is documented here: [Managing teams and people
with access to your
repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository)
